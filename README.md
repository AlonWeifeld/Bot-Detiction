# Bot-Detiction

Twitter Bot Detection Models
Overview
This repository contains machine learning models for detecting Twitter bots. Each Jupyter notebook in the repository corresponds to a different machine learning model used for classification:

Xgboost.ipynb - Utilizes the XGBoost algorithm for bot detection.
Gui_project.ipynb - A GUI-based application to input Twitter user data and predict whether the account is a bot.
LR.ipynb - Implements Logistic Regression for bot detection.
RF.ipynb - Applies the Random Forest Classifier for identifying bots.
SVM.ipynb - Uses Support Vector Machine for bot classification.
Prerequisites
Before running these notebooks, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Scikit-learn
XGBoost
Pandas
Numpy
Tweepy (for the GUI project)
Joblib
